<h3>What is asymmetric cryptograpy?</h3>
<p/>Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, requires two separate keys, one of which is private and one of which is public. Although different, the two parts of this key pair are mathematically linked. The public key is used, for example, to encrypt plaintext or to verify a digital signature; whereas the private key is used for the opposite operation, in these examples to decrypt ciphertext or to create a digital signature. The term "asymmetric" stems from the use of different keys to perform these opposite functions, each the inverse of the other â€“ as contrasted with conventional ("symmetric") cryptography which relies on the same key to perform both..<br/>

Mathematically a public key is based on the two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers must be kept secret. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, but with currently published methods, if the public key is large enough, only someone with knowledge of the prime numbers can feasibly decode the message.</p>

<p>Your public key isn't like a physical key, because it is stored in the open in an online directory called a keyserver. People download it and use it, along with PGP, to encrypt emails they send to you. You can think of the keyserver as phonebook, where people who want to send you an encrypted email look up your public key.</p>

<p>Your private key is more like a physical key, because you keep it to yourself (on your computer). You use your private key to decode encrypted emails other people send to you.</p>
