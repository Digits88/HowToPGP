<p>The Enigmail Setup wizard may start automatically. If it doesn't, select Enigmail &rarr; Setup Wizard from your email program's menu. You don't need to read the text in the window that pops up unless you'd like to, but it's good to read the text on the later screens of the wizard. Click Next with the default options selected, except in these instances:</p>
<p>On the screen titled "Encryption," select "Encrypt all of my messages by default, because privacy is critical to me."</p>
<p>On the screen titled "Signing," select "Don't sign my messages by default."</p>
<p>On the screen titled "Key Selection," select "I want to create a new key pair for signing and encrypting my email."</p>
<p>On the screen titled "Create Key," pick a strong password! Your password should be at least 12 characters and include at least one lower case and upper case letter and at least one number or punctuation symbol. Don't forget the password, or all this work will be wasted!
</p>
<p>The program will take a little while to finish the next step, the "Key Creation" screen. While you wait, do something else with your computer, like watching a movie or browsing the Web. The more you use the computer at this point, the faster the key creation will go.</p>
<p>When the "Key Generation Completed" screen pops up, select Generate Certificate and choose to save it in a safe place on your computer (we recommend making a folder called "Revocation Certificate" in your home folder and keeping it there). You'll learn more about the revocation certificate in </p>


<em><h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
						
<p>I can't find the Enigmail menu.<br/>In many new email programs, the main menu is represented by an image of three stacked horizontal bars. Enigmail may be inside a section called Tools.</p>
<p>The wizard says that it cannot find GnuPG.<br/>Open whatever program you usually use for installing software, and search for GnuPG, then install it. Then restart the  Enigmail setup wizard by going to Enigmail &rarr; Setup Wizard.</p></em>
