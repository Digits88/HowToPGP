<h2> Use it well</h2>
<p>Everyone uses GnuPG a little differently, but it's important to follow some basic practices to keep your email secure. Not following them, you risk the privacy of the people you communicate with, as well as your own, and damage the Web of Trust.</p>
				
<h3>When should I encrypt?</h3>

<p>The more you can encrypt your messages, the better. If you only encrypt emails occasionally, each encrypted message could raise a red flag for surveillance systems. If all or most of your email is encrypted, people doing surveillance won't know where to start.</p>

<p>That's not to say that only encrypting some of your email isn't helpful -- it's a great start and it makes bulk surveillance more difficult.</p>

<h3><em>Important:</em> Be wary of invalid keys</h3>
<p>GnuPG makes email safer, but it's still important to watch out for invalid keys, which might have fallen into the wrong hands. Email encrypted with invalid keys might be readable by surveillance programs.</p>
<p>In your email program, go back to the second email that Edward sent you. Because Edward encrypted it with your public key, it will have a message from Enigmail at the top, which most likely says "Enigmail: Part of this message encrypted."</p>
<p><b>When using GnuPG, make a habit of glancing at that bar. The program will warn you there if you get an email encrypted with a key that can't be trusted.</b></p>
					
<h3>Copy your revocation certificate to somewhere safe</h3>
<p>Remember when you created your keys and saved the revocation certificate that GnuPG made? It's time to copy that certificate onto the safest digital storage that you have -- the ideal thing is a flash drive, disk, or hard drive stored in a safe place in your home.</p>
<p>If your private key ever gets lost or stolen, you'll need this certificate file to let people know that you are no longer using that keypair.</p>
					
<h3><em>Important:</em> act swiftly if someone gets your private key</h3>
						<p>If you lose your private key or someone else gets ahold of it (say, by stealing or cracking your computer), it's important to revoke it immediately before someone else uses it to read your encrypted email. This guide doesn't cover how to revoke a key, but you can follow the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN305" target="_blank">instructions on the GnuPG site</a>. After you're done revoking, send an email to everyone with whom you usually use your key to make sure they know.</p>
