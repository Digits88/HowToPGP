<p>To use PGP, you'll need a public key and a private key (known together as a keypair). Each is a long string of randomly generated numbers and letters that are unique to you. Your public and private keys are linked together by a special mathematical function.</p>
<p>Your public key isn't like a physical key, because it is stored in the open in an online directory called a keyserver. People download it and use it to encrypt emails they send to you. You can think of the keyserver as phonebook, where people who want to send you an encrypted email look up your public key.</p>

<p>Your private key is more like a physical key, because you keep it to yourself (on your computer). You use your private key to decode encrypted emails other people send to you.</p>
