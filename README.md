# HowToPGP

A ["Jugend hackt"](http://jugendhackt.de/) project.

  

We want to explain [PGP-encryption](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) 
simple and understandable for everyone. PGP is a very secure way to encrypt your e-mails, but is it not that easy to install and to use. Only by teaching a wide bandwidth of people how to use encryption, we are able to stop mass surveillance.

  

**Our website is available in English and German.**
